# RIR-Generator-Python

This repository contains an implementation of the image method proposed by Allen and Berkley [1],
which is used to generate synthetic room impulse responses (RIRs).

This implementation is based on that developed by Habets ([github](https://github.com/ehabets/RIR-Generator)).
The original implementation is a mex-function, which can be used in MATLAB,
and I modifed the interface of that to make it possible to be used in Python.
